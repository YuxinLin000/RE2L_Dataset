# REal-world 2-dimensional Low-light (RE2L) Dataset
## Dataset description
To fully benchmark outdoor Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), a large-scale and real-world low-light dataset with naturally changed illumination environment is needed. In this work, we propose a novel REal-world 2-dimentional Low-light dataset, dubbed RE2L, which is acquired not only based on manually adjusted exposure level (i.e., the exposure dimension in RE2L), but also collecting images at different times of a day to capture the natural light change (i.e., timing dimension) where complex outdoor lighting conditions are well-captured. 

As RE2L provides more comprehensive information of illumination variations, models targeting outdoor LLIE will be better guided in training towards state-of-the-art results.
